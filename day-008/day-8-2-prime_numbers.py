'''Prime Numbers

Instructions
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by itself and 1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

Example Input 1
73
Example Output 1
It's a prime number.
Example Input 2
75
Example Output 2
It's not a prime number.
Hint
Remember the modulus:

Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code.

Use the same wording as the Example Outputs to make sure the tests pass.'''

# My wrong solution:
def prime_checker(number):
    while number > 1 and number in range(0, 101):
        if number % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{number} is not a prime number")
            break
        elif number // number:
            print(f"{number} is a prime number")
            break
        else:
            print("Please, provide a number.")
            continue

#Write your code above this line 👆
    
#Do NOT change any of the code below👇
n = int(input("Check this number: "))
prime_checker(number=n)


### Correct solution:
def prime_checker(number):
    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, number):
        if number % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
    if is_prime:
        print("It's a prime number.")
    else:
        print("It's not a prime number.")

n = int(input("Check this number: "))
prime_checker(number=n)
